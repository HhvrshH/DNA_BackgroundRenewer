**Setup on launch:**

	1. Finger Print Key - if enabled **(1)**, enter the key to obtain fingerprints, available here - https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com/
3. Threads - number of concurrently running threads.
8. Sleep (in sec) - Sleep range.
11. Clear DoneList - After successful claiming or errors, private keys are recorded in the `done_list.txt` file. This helps the software understand which accounts it has passed and which ones it hasn't in case you interrupt its operation or the thread finishes with an error. If you need to run all wallets again, choose Yes.

**Settings in files:**

`private.txt` - private keys.

`proxy.txt` - proxies, selected line by line.
